Topic hierarchy
===============

wis2box implements the WIS2 topic hierarchies, which are designed to efficiently
categorize and classify data.

To publish data and metadata to WIS2, the topic hierarchy requires a valid centre
identifier (``centre-id``), which is specified by the member endorsed by the
Permananent Representative (PR) of the country.
