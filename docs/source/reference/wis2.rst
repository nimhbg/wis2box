WIS2
====

The `WMO Information System 2.0`_ (WIS2) is the framework for WMO data sharing for all WMO domains and disciplines. The Commission for Observation, Infrastructure and Information Systems (`INFCOM`_) approved the technical specifications of WIS 2.0 and its implementation plan in October 2022.

WIS2 will gradually replace the Global Telecommunication System (GTS).

WIS2 was designed to support the WMO Unified Data policy and the Global Basic Observing Network (GBON), and to make data sharing between WMO Members simple, effective and cost-efficient.
The idea that *no Member should be left behind* and the objective of lowering the barrier to adoption has been at the core of WIS2 development.

These objectives inspire the principles underpinning the WIS2 technical framework, such as adopting Open Standards and Web technologies to facilitate sharing of increasing variety and volume of real-time data.  

The `Manual`_ on the WMO Information System (WMO-No.1060), Volume II contains standard and recommended practices, procedures, and specifications.

The `Guide`_ to the WMO Information System (WMO-No.1061), Volume II provides additional information concerning practices, procedures, 
and specifications that Members are invited to follow or implement in establishing and conducting their arrangements in compliance with the WMO Technical Regulations 
and in developing meteorological and hydrological data services.
