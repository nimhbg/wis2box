What is WIS2 in a box?
======================

WIS2 in a box (wis2box) is a Reference Implementation of a WIS2 Node, designed to help accelerate international data and metadata exchange on WIS 2.0.

wis2box was designed to be to be cost-effective and low barrier to operate, to enable any WMO Member to publish and receive internationally exchanged weather data.

wis2box is Free and Open Source and released under the `Apache License <https://docs.wis2box.wis.wmo.int/en/latest/community/license.html>`_.

wis2box consists of multiple software packages that provide all services required to run a WIS2 Node, namely:

- `https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box <https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box>`_ Core services to publish WIS2 Discovery Metadata and  Notification Messages
- `https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-api <https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-api>`_  Application Programming Interface that provides an OGC API to discover, access, and visualize notifications, data -collections and configuration (datasets, stations) and which provides support for data handling of WMO encodings and formats
- `https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-ui <https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-ui>`_ User interface to display datasets and provide visualizations for ingested data
- `https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-webapp <https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-webapp>`_ Web -application to interactively configure wis2box and monitor published data
- `https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-auth <https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2box-auth>`_ Access control functionality to datasets exposed via wis2box and to apply authentication API services used by wis2box-webapp
- `https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2downloader <https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/wis2downloader>`_ Subscription and download capability for access to data published by other WIS2 Nodes

WIS2 in a box is released using a Deployment Bundle that simplifies the setup of a WIS2 Node by providing all required services as Docker containers.

The release archive consists of a set of Docker Compose files and Python scripts, referencing pre-built Docker images stored in the wis2box software repositories on GitHub.

In addition to the wis2box software packages mentioned above, wis2box  leverages the following Free and Open Source Software (FOSS):

- storage using `MinIO <https://min.io/docs/minio/container/index.html>`_
- MQTT broker using `mosquitto <https://mosquitto.org/>`_ 
- Web proxy using `nginx <https://nginx.org/en/>`_
- `OGC API <https://ogcapi.ogc.org/>`_ capability using `pygeoapi <https://pygeoapi.io/>`_
- API backend using `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html>`_
- Monitoring dashboards using `Grafana <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-docker/>`_	
- Metrics collection using `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`_
- Log storage using `Loki <https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/install/docker/>`_	
- WMO format encoding/decoding using `ecCodes <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC>`_ 

Requirements to run a WIS2 Node using the wis2box deployment bundle:

1.	**Host instance that is routed to the public Internet**, hosted in the cloud or in a high-performance on-premise data-centre
2.	**Host OS using Ubuntu with Python, Docker and Docker Compose pre-installed**

Please follow :ref:`getting-started` for more information on the host-requirements and to start running a WIS2 Node using the wis2box deployment bundle.
